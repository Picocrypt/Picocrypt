    <p>
      Picocrypt is a very small (hence Pico), very simple, yet very secure encryption tool that you can use to protect your files. It is designed to be the go-to tool for encryption, with a focus on security, simplicity, and reliability. Picocrypt uses the secure XChaCha20 cipher and the Argon2id key derivation function to provide a high level of security, even from three-letter agencies like the NSA. Your privacy and security is under attack. Take it back with confidence by protecting your files with Picocrypt. For a more detailed information, please visit the main page of the project.
